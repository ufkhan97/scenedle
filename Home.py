Your hearing aid is about to bust if they keep playing, but if you're rude, the llama will spit on you. What do you do to make it quieter without becoming a saliva statue?"

Your cat is slowly pushing your laptop off the desk, and your roommate just started a very loud vacuum cleaning session. What do you do to maintain your professional composure and save your laptop without revealing your sticky situation?"

You have an important job interview in an hour, but your car keys are now too heavy to lift. What do you do to get to your interview on time and explain your tiny predicament?"

    The person's plan to solve it is: {user_plan}

    Simulate what would happen if they did this. Be creative and humorous in your description. Keep the entire simulation under 110 words.

    Follow these steps:

    1. Start directly with the outcome, without any introductory phrases.
    2. Play out the scenario step by step, including:
       a. Initial actions based on the person's plan
       b. Immediate consequences of those actions
       c. Any unexpected twists that occur
       d. How the situation evolves or escalates
       e. The final resolution or outcome
    3. At the end, provide a success percentage (to 2 decimal points) based on how well the plan solved the original problem.
    4. At the end, use no more than 3 lines of 7 emojis each to summarize what happened. Never use the same emoji twice in a row. The first line should be the initial situation, the second line the outcome, and the third line the final resolution.

    Remember to maintain a lighthearted and entertaining tone throughout the simulation.
